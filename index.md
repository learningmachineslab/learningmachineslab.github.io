### Solving Discipline Based Education Research Problems With Machine Learning

We are building a research activity using modern analytical tools such as machine learning network analysis, natural language processing, and simulation to research science education.  We are opening a whole new toolbox of analytical methods and apply them on new datasets such as registrar data, concept inventories, classroom participating, student coding and interactions with web platforms.

This project is led by an interdisciplinary team of professional experts based on data science and discipline based education research. Our team consists of professors,  post-docs, PhD fellows, master students and undergraduate research students. The team is based on a collaboration between the [Center for Computing in Science Education (CCSE)](http://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/) and the internationally leading [Physics Education Research Lab at Michigan State University (MSU)](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/).
