<img style="float: right;" width="200" src="/assets/markyd.jpg">

Associate Professor Danny Caballero is an outstanding researcher and teacher within physics and science education. He leads the Physics Education Research Lab at Michigan State University and is Professor II at the Center for Computing in Science Education at UiO. He helped start the Georgia Tech Physics Education Research Group in 2007, and has worked on integrating calculations in physics education. His research interests are related to how students learn physics through the use of mathematics, computer calculations and language. He uses cognitive and socio-cultural learning approaches. He is leading a major NSF project, PICUP, where he is working on developing and teaching university teachers in how to teach physics with integrated calculations. He has published a number of scientific works on physics education in general and on the effect of integrating data bills into physics education.

 Rachel Henderson is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University (MSU). Working in the Physics Education Research Lab (PERL) at MSU, her research focus is on developing formal structures to support transformed physics laboratories while developing assessment tools and practices for understanding student learning in these laboratory courses. Rachel recently finished her doctoral work in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at West Virginia University where she focused her research on exploring how classroom diversity and inclusion impacted student performance on the most commonly used conceptual physics assessments in the introductory physics classroom.

### Alexis V. Knaub

<img style="float: right;" width="260" src="/assets/louise.jpeg">

Alexis V. Knaub works as an external evaluator on several grants aimed at improving STEM education. Her research interests include sustaining and changing improvements in postsecondary STEM education from departments to institutions to the DBER field itself. Both this research area and her external evaluation work has allowed her do a variety of studies and use many techniques including: using social network analysis to study faculty and student groups; interviewing key faculty and administration to determine the viability of an innovation; and using concept inventory data to inform class practices. Her teaching backgrounds includes working as a two-year college instructor, working with Learning Assistants, and teaching a pre-practicum for prospective K-12 teachers. Her professional service includes mentoring through the APS National Mentoring Community and the Gates Millennium Scholars. She earned a bachelor's in physics from Smith College, a master's in physics from DePaul University, and a doctorate in science education (focused on physics education) from Boston University's School of Education.

### John M. Aiken (Johnny M.)
[google scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=OFBaoZEAAAAJ&hl=en)

<img style="float: right;" width="260" src="/assets/johnnym.jpg">

My research has focused on micro problems of education research (how students learn and engage during single activities or experiences) up to macro problems of education research (how students make decisions across courses or degree programs). My work in understanding how high school students conceive computational models was part of the basis for a teacher professional development program that engaged 40+ Atlanta area high school physics teachers. I also investigated how students in Massive Open Online Courses interact with different course materials focusing on video lectures. This work led to several publications. My current work focuses on how students in STEM majors make decisions to stay in their major, switch to other STEM majors, or leave STEM altogether. This work fills a crucial gap in the research literature as it is wholly quantitative.
I have also directed [a short film on scientific modeling](http://youtu.be/dkTncoPqo5Y) that has over 20k views on YouTube and is shown as an introduction in some American high school physics classrooms.

### Nick Young (Little Nicky)

<img style="float: right;" width="100" src="/assets/keanu-reeves-2000.jpg">

Nick Young is a physics graduate student at Michigan State University. His research is focused on applying machine learning methods to educational data. Currently, he is investigating factors that are predictive of whether a physics faculty member will include computation in their course. As an undergraduate at (The) Ohio State University, he investigated hierarchies in student understanding of period, frequency, and angular frequency. It was there that he first learned to use R and now spends a considerable amount of time convincing the rest of the team to use R as well.

Robert is a Msc. student at the University of Oslo (UiO). His studies are focused on approximate many body methods in physics while his research is in quantitative methods for understanding student performance and behaviour in physics education. So far his research has been in working with data from students interacting with lecture videos.  For his work on student behaviour and in his studies Robert has focused on understanding and applying both traditional and cutting edge machine learning algorithms.

### Lyssa Waterson ('The Boss')

<img style="float: right;" width="200" src="/assets/mob boss.jpg">

I am an Undergraduate Researcher and Learning Assistant at Michigan State University, working in collaboration with both the Physics Education Research Lab at MSU and with the Computational Science group at the University of Oslo. My research has been both quantitative and qualitative – I have developed a model of ‘how to plan to solve a problem’ in a group-based learning curriculum, and as well I am developing a model of how to analyze students with transfer credits at MSU using Python. I have been a part of the research community for two years and graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Physics in Fall 2018.

### Matt Ring (the One)

<img style="float: right;" width="200" src="/assets/The-giver-character-posters-brenton-thwaites-jonas.jpg">

Matthew Ring is an undergraduate researcher working with the Physics Education Research Lab at Michigan State University. Under the supervision of John Aiken and Dr. Caballero, Matt has begun analyzing the impact of introductory chemistry curriculum transformation at Michigan State University. His research focuses on how the change to Chemistry, Life, the Universe and Everything (CLUE) curriculum has impacted future student performance. This transformation’s impact on underrepresented minority students is especially of interest. Much of his work has taken place at Oslo University, but Matt will be graduating from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Physics. Matt also plans to minor in the department of Computational Modeling for Science and Engineers, science policy, and mathematics at Michigan State.
