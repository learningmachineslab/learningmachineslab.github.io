Associate Professor Danny Caballero is an outstanding researcher and teacher within physics and science education. He leads the Physics Education Research Lab at Michigan State University and is Professor II at the Center for Computing in Science Education at UiO. He helped start the Georgia Tech Physics Education Research Group in 2007, and has worked on integrating calculations in physics education. His research interests are related to how students learn physics through the use of mathematics, computer calculations and language. He uses cognitive and socio-cultural learning approaches. He is leading a major NSF project, PICUP, where he is working on developing and teaching university teachers in how to teach physics with integrated calculations. He has published a number of scientific works on physics education in general and on the effect of integrating data bills into physics education.

My research has focused on micro problems of education research (how students learn and engage during single activities or experiences) up to macro problems of education research (how students make decisions across courses or degree programs). My work in understanding how high school students conceive computational models was part of the basis for a teacher professional development program that engaged 40+ Atlanta area high school physics teachers. I also investigated how students in Massive Open Online Courses interact with different course materials focusing on video lectures. This work led to several publications. My current work focuses on how students in STEM majors make decisions to stay in their major, switch to other STEM majors, or leave STEM altogether. This work fills a crucial gap in the research literature as it is wholly quantitative.
I have also directed a short film on scientific modeling that has over 20k views on YouTube and is shown as an introduction in some American high school physics classrooms.
